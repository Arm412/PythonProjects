My Local Fair simulation was made with Python version 3.
The parameters to the program are 2 integers that correspond to carousel size and game stall capacity
Game stall capacity would be 50 for 10 stalls, 45 for 9 stalls, 40 for 8 stalls, etc.
Basically, its not how many stalls you want, its how many people can go into all the game stalls
Example: main.py [integer of carousel capacity][integer of how many people can enter the game stalls]
